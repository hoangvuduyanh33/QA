# About this work
This is a work on a NLP course at our school, in particular, on open-domain question answering.

# Our approach
* The baseline is DrQA as suggested by the instructor. About DrQA, please refer to [DrQA's official repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DrQA) for more information (paper, intr, ciation, license, ...)
* Improve the retrieval stage with better schemes (researching)
* Leverage Huggingface transformers framework, with better models such as BERT.
* Apply the methods to our Vietnamese language.

# Installation
* Clone the repo & run: `python setup.py develop`
* Install [Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) with $JAVA_HOME environment variable set up correctly, according to [pyserini](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini#package-installation)
* Data (db, models, index file...) (to be updated)
